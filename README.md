> [!NOTE]
> **Arrow Out** is a beautifully designed, highly interactive grid-based puzzle game. Players navigate challenges by sliding arrows out of the grid, encountering progressively harder difficulties (from Easy up to Boss & Super Hard levels). Developed using the powerful Flame game engine for Flutter, it offers responsive animations, particle effects, and dynamic transitions.

## <a id="-features"></a><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Features-9C27B0?style=flat-square&logo=sparkles&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Core Features

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Gameplay-43A047?style=flat-square&logo=gamepad&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Engaging Gameplay
* ✦ **Slide Mechanics:** Smooth grid movements with intuitive touch controls.
* ✦ **Progressive Difficulty:** Levels ranging from simple tutorial-like grids to mind-bending Boss and Super Hard configurations (up to 500 levels).
* ✦ **Deflector Dots (Orphan Dots):** Isolated cells remaining after generation are converted to deflectors. 
  * Starting levels ($\le 20$) feature neutral (grey) dots that arrows pass straight through.
  * Higher levels introduce red (clockwise/right) and blue (counter-clockwise/left) deflector dots.
* ✦ **Daily Streaks:** Tracks user gameplay consistency and records daily play sessions.
* ✦ **Lives System:** Keep track of remaining lives with custom visual meters and animated, synchronized heart icons.
* ✦ **Timed Challenges:** God levels (after level 100) and Boss levels (after level 200) feature dynamic countdown timers. The duration scales with the difficulty and quantity of arrows. Resuming from a timeout via rewarded ads grants a dynamic extra time buffer matching the quantity of remaining arrows, coupled with an observer-driven auto-pause system for background/foreground transitions.

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Juice-E040FB?style=flat-square&logo=sparkles&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Visual & Sound Effects
* ✦ **Juicy Animations:** Utilizes `flutter_animate`, Confetti, and custom Lottie integrations for satisfying level-complete feedback.
* ✦ **Soundtracks & SFX:** Rich audio feedback powered by `flame_audio` and `audioplayers` for sliding, matching, winning, and losing states.
* ✦ **Premium UI:** Designed with HSL-tailored colors, smooth gradients, and custom Nunito typography.

## <a id="-game-engine"></a><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Engine-4CAF50?style=flat-square&logo=cpu&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Game Engine & Level Generation

The game leverages the **Flame Engine** (a modular Flutter game engine library) to manage high-frequency rendering ticks, touch gestures, physics simulation, and particles.

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Loop-607D8B?style=flat-square&logo=settings&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Game Loop & Engine Flow
The game loop runs on a dual-phase execution tick:
1. **Update Phase (`update(double dt)`)**: Evaluates real-time animations (e.g. arrow slide offsets, rotation angles, particle decay times) and updates the logical coordinate grid in `GameState`.
2. **Render Phase (`render(Canvas canvas)`)**: Draws grid cells, deflector plates, standard arrows, and particle effects directly onto the double-buffered screen canvas.

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pipeline-E91E63?style=flat-square&logo=git-commit&logoColor=white" align="center" /> The Level Generation Pipeline
Every level is fully generated programmatically and deterministically from a level number seed:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Seeded Random (levelNumber)"] --> B["Shape Selection & Mask Generation"]
    B --> C["Phase 1 & 2: Grow Long/Medium Arrows (exit inward)"]
    C --> D["Phase 3: Pack Remaining Space (Length-2 pairs)"]
    D --> E["Phase 4: Assign Safe Deflector Directions (reverse-trace)"]
    E --> F["Phase 5: Apply Mechanics (ColorLock groups)"]
    F --> G["Level Verification via Backtracking Solver (DFS)"]
    G -- "Unsolvable / Cap Hit" --> A
    G -- "Verified Solvable" --> H["Accept Level Model"]
```

- **Seeded Randomness**: Uses `Random(levelNumber * 103 + 51)` to produce identical layouts for a given level ID across all player devices.
- **Inward Growth (Phases 1 & 2)**: Starts by finding exit boundary cells and growing arrow paths inward. This guarantees that at least a subset of arrows can exit without obstructions.
- **Length-2 Packing (Phase 3)**: Sweeps remaining isolated tiles using a center-out shuffled search grid, preventing clustering of small arrows.
- **Reverse Exit Deflector Routing (Phase 4)**: Unassigned orphan cells are converted to redirect dots. The generator simulates arrow exits in reverse construction order and configures deflection directions that guarantee a safe path to the grid boundaries.
- **Solver Backtracking DFS Verification**: A custom depth-first search solver parses the generated board. The layout is accepted only if it solves within a dynamic state cap (1000 states for small grids, 2500 states for grids larger than 20x20). Otherwise, it resets the seed and restarts generation.

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Level_Data-1565C0?style=flat-square&logo=database&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Level Data Asset (`assets/levels.bin`)

Boss and God levels use large 30×30 grids with up to 200 arrows — generating them on-device causes freezes. All 500 levels are pre-generated on PC and shipped as a single compact binary file (`assets/levels.bin`, **791 KB**).

The binary format uses:
- **Bitmask grid masks** — 113 bytes per 30×30 grid instead of hundreds of coordinate strings
- **Delta-encoded arrow paths** — 1 byte per step instead of full `[row, col]` pairs
- **Index table** — O(1) seek to any level by number, no scanning

```
[HEADER]       8 bytes   magic 'LVLB' + version + level count
[INDEX TABLE]  N × 4 bytes  byte offset of each level record
[DATA]         per level: gridSize, maskShape, difficulty, patternName,
               arrows (direction/mechanic/path as delta steps),
               mask bitmask, orphan dots
```

`LevelRepository` loads only the header on startup and seeks directly to whichever level is needed — the rest of the file is untouched.

#### Regenerating & Verifying `levels.bin`

To verify all 500 levels and regenerate any unsolvable ones, run the parallel check-and-fix pipeline. This splits the work across 5 parallel processes on multiple CPU cores:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run_parallel.ps1
```
This script will spawn the concurrent jobs, optimize their priorities to High, display live progress logs, and automatically merge and spot-verify the final output file `assets/levels.bin`.


#### Scaling to more levels
1. Change `const totalLevels = 500` → your new count in `test/generate_and_verify_test.dart`
2. Update `static int get totalLevels => 500` in `lib/data/repositories/level_repository.dart`
3. Re-run the generator — the index table grows automatically



### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Components-3F51B5?style=flat-square&logo=navigation&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Arrow Definition & Components
Arrows are modeled in `ArrowModel` and rendered by `ArrowComponent`:
- **Logical Model (`ArrowModel`)**: Defines the ID, head cell coordinate `(row, col)`, exit direction `ArrowDirection` (up, down, left, right), coordinate segment list (`path`), state (idle, sliding, blocked, exited), and color-locked grouping ID.
- **Visual Component (`ArrowComponent`)**: Standard arrows are drawn with a curved head, distinct segment separators, and a flat tail. They automatically compute slide offsets and orientation rotations dynamically during slide transitions.

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Math-FF5722?style=flat-square&logo=maths&logoColor=white" align="center" /> Algorithmic Mechanics

The generator models the puzzle constraints mathematically to guarantee solvable and challenging states:

#### 1. Dynamic Grid Scaling
The board dimensions grow dynamically as a function of the level number:
$$\text{Grid Size } (G) = \text{clamp}\Big(10, \,\, 10 + \big\lfloor (L - 3) \times 0.115 \big\rfloor, \,\, 30\Big)$$
where $L$ represents the level number.

#### 2. Deflector Density (Orphan Bounds)
The target quantity of deflector dots is computed as a percentage of the total active mask area ($M$) and is capped:
$$E_{\text{max}} = \text{clamp}\Big(5, \,\, \lceil M \times P \rceil, \,\, 150\Big)$$
where the density coefficient $P$ scales based on grid dimensions:
$$P = \begin{cases} 16\% & \text{if } G > 20 \\ 22\% & \text{if } G \le 20 \end{cases}$$

#### 3. Arrow Type Distributions
The arrow lengths follow a discrete target ratio among standard paths ($\text{Length} \ge 3$):
- **Medium Arrows** ($3 \le \text{Length} \le 5$): $\approx 65\%$
- **Long Arrows** ($\text{Length} \ge 6$): $\approx 35\%$

#### 4. Solvability Constraints
A board state $S = (A, D)$ is solvable if there exists a valid slide sequence $\pi$:
$$\pi = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N) \in \text{Permutations}(A) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall i, \,\, a_i \xrightarrow{\text{slide}} \text{Exit}(G, D_{i-1})$$
where $D_{i-1}$ represents the remaining deflector dot configurations on the grid after removing $a_1 \dots a_{i-1}$.
